JOTTER APP

I needed a note-taking app to keep track of my to-do list, rather than downloading one I decided that this would be a great way to test out my React skills before tackling a couple of larger projects I had in mind.

Jotter uses local storage and provides the ability to create, edit and delete notes.

The Apk file for this note-taking app is available for download on my portfolio. The link to the portfolio is in the profile section of my GIT account.

Just to be aware, Iâ€™ll be making changes to the app as and when I require additional functionality.

Feel free to take a look at the code, if you have any recommendations or ideas, please let me know.
